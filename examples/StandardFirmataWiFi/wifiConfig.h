 * WIFI CONFIGURATION
 *
 * You must configure your particular hardware. Follow the steps below.
 *
 * Currently StandardFirmataWiFi is configured as a server. An option to
 * configure as a client may be added in the future.
 *============================================================================*/

// STEP 1 [REQUIRED]
// Uncomment / comment the appropriate set of includes for your hardware (OPTION A, B or C)
// Option A is enabled by default.

/*
 * OPTION A: Configure for Arduino WiFi shield
 *
 * This will configure StandardFirmataWiFi to use the original WiFi library (deprecated) provided
 * with the Arduino IDE. It is supported by the Arduino WiFi shield (a discontinued product) and
 * is compatible with 802.11 B/G networks.
 *
 * To configure StandardFirmataWiFi to use the Arduino WiFi shield
 * leave the #define below uncommented.

/*
 * OPTION B: Configure for WiFi 101
 *
 * This will configure StandardFirmataWiFi to use the WiFi101 library, which works with the Arduino WiFi101
 * shield and devices that have the WiFi101 chip built in (such as the MKR1000). It is compatible
 * with 802.11 B/G/N networks.
 *
 * To enable, uncomment the #define WIFI_101 below and verify the #define values under
 * options A and C are commented out.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: You must have the WiFI 101 library installed. To easily install this library, opent the library manager via:
 * Arduino IDE Menus: Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > filter search for "WiFi101" > Select the result and click 'install'

/*
 * OPTION C: Configure for ESP8266
 *
 * This will configure StandardFirmataWiFi to use the ESP8266WiFi library for boards
 * with an ESP8266 chip. It is compatible with 802.11 B/G/N networks.
 *
 * To enable, uncomment the #define ESP8266_WIFI below and verify the #define values under
 * options A and B are commented out.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: You must have the esp8266 board support installed. To easily install this board, open the board manager via:
 * Arduino IDE Menus: Tools > Board > Manage Boards > filter search for "esp8266" > Select the result and click 'install'

/*
 * OPTION D: Configure for HUZZAH
 *
 * HUZZAH with CC3000 is not yet supported, this will be added in a later revision to StandardFirmataWiFi.
 * For HUZZAH with ESP8266 use ESP8266_WIFI.
