 * WIFI CONFIGURATION
 *
 * You must configure your particular hardware. Follow the steps below.
 *
 * By default, StandardFirmataWiFi is configured as a TCP server, to configure
 * as a TCP client, see STEP 2.
 *============================================================================*/

// STEP 1 [REQUIRED]
// Uncomment / comment the appropriate set of includes for your hardware (OPTION A ... F)
// Arduino MKR1000, ESP8266 and ESP32 are enabled by default if compiling for either of those boards.

/*
 * OPTION A: Configure for Arduino MKR1000 or Arduino WiFi Shield 101
 *
 * This will configure StandardFirmataWiFi to use the WiFi101 library, which works with the
 * Arduino WiFi101 shield and devices that have the WiFi101 chip built in (such as the MKR1000).
 * It is compatible with 802.11 B/G/N networks.
 *
 * If you are using the MKR1000 board, continue on to STEP 2. If you are using the WiFi 101 shield,
 * follow the instructions below.
 *
 * To enable for the WiFi 101 shield, uncomment the #define WIFI_101 below and verify the
 * #define ARDUINO_WIFI_SHIELD is commented out for OPTION B.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: You must have the WiFI 101 library installed. To easily install this library, open
 * the library manager via: Arduino IDE Menus: Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > filter
 * search for "WiFi101" > Select the result and click 'install'
