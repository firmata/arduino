* public methods.
* Added Intel Galileo to Boards.h
* Renamed FirmataSerial to FirmataStream
* Updated to latest Arduino library format
* writePort function in Boards.h now returns 1 (to suppress compiler warning)
* Updated syntax highlighting (keywords.txt)
* Fixed IS_PIN_SPI ifndef condition in boards.h
* Added constants to Firmata.h to reserve configurable firmata features
* Fixed issue where firmwareName was not reported correctly in Windows
* Fixed memory leak when receiving String via STRING_DATA command
  (note this change may break existing code if you were manually deallocating
  the incomming string in your string callback function. See code for details)
* Added ability for user to specify a filename when calling setFirmwareNameAndVersion
* Increased input data buffer size from 32 to 64 bytes

[StandardFirmata]
* Fixed management of unexpected sized I2C replies (Nahuel Greco)
* Fixed a bug when removing a monitored device with I2C_STOP_Reading (Nahuel Greco)
* Fixed conditional expression in I2C_STOP_READING case
* Changed samplingInterval from type int to type unsigned int
* Shortened error message strings to save a few bytes

[examples]
* Removed makefiles from examples (because they were not being updated)
* Updated all examples to set current firmware version

FIRMATA 2.2 (changes prior to Firmata 2.3.0 were not well documented)

* changes undocumented

FIRMATA 2.1
